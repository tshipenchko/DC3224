# Practical Assignment for Students

## Practical Task #1: Multithreaded Application for Array Sum Calculation

### Objective:
- Learn the basics of multithreading.
- Implement a program that uses multiple threads to speed up calculations.
- Practice dividing tasks into parts and combining results.

### Part 1: Main Task

Write a Java program that:
- Creates an array of 100 elements filled with numbers from 1 to 100.
- Splits the array into 4 parts, each processed by a separate thread.
- Calculates the sum of each part of the array in its own thread.
- Combines the results from all threads and prints the total sum of the array.

### Requirements:
- Use `Thread` or `Runnable` classes.
- Print the following to the console:
  - The sum of each part of the array.
  - The total sum.
